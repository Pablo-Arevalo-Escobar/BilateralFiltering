# BilateralFiltering
Bilateral Filtering Implementation, done as a team of two in Matlab, based on the "Bilateral Filtering for Gray and Color Images" paper by
C. Tomasi and R. Manduchi. 

The attached report provides a review of the paper, metrics and details of our implementation. An example of the effects of the bilateral filter we implemented is shown below:
